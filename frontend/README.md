# Next.js Frontend

This project was bootstrapped with Next.js 14+, using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and the App Router. All source code is located in the `/src` directory.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Migrating from React (CRA)
- Move your components and pages from the old `frontend/src` to the new `/src` directory.
- Update imports to use Next.js conventions.
- See the Next.js docs for [migrating from Create React App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/cra-to-next).
